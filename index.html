        <p>Hi! I am Anushka, and I am a Electrical Engineering and Computer Science major at UC Berkeley. I love to play all racket sports, from tennis, to badminton, and ping pong. I also have been playing piano since I was 5. I spend a lot of my freetime baking and my most popular dessert are my lemon  bars! I also am a dancer on the UC Berkeley Raas Ramzat team.</p>
